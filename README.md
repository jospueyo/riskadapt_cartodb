## WEBSITE TO ENTER GIS POINTS TO A CARTO.COM DATASET

It uses JS for the UI and PHP to send the data to CARTO.COM

JS libraries used:
1. Leaflet
2. Leaflet.draw
3. JQuery

Two PHP files are not in the repository for privacity:

1. users.php (contains authentication information)
2. cartoDBproxy.php (contains the API key of CARTO.COM)

If you are interested in these two files, just let me know.
